[b]Discussion:[/b]
The original posting can be found [URL="http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/delta-air-lines-skymiles/1556378-untested-guide-complex-online-multi-carrier-bookings-006-dl.html"]here[/URL], related to building links on delta's booking engine. The script scrapes the flight info from the itinerary (flight numbers, dates, class of service, price) and builds a link string to two booking engines (Orbitz/Delta). These links are the same links used by Google Flights (owns ITA) , Kayak, et. al. to drive purchases. I used the Google referrer codes in the scripts, so they should get the commission. It's beyond me why ITA doesn't have some form of purchase link. This a userscript, and like an ad-blocker, it modifies the way a page is viewed by editing DOM objects in the browser. Keep in mind that this tool is meant to do something you already do yourself, but to save time in the process. Any tickets issued by Orbitz/DL via these links could be issued via phone or web search. If the links work, you are avoiding a phone booking fee potentially.

[b]Caveats:[/b]
Not all fares will be bookable or will price correctly in the booking engines, especially the Delta one.
